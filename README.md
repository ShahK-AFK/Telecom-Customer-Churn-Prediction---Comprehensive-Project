# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction---Comprehensive-Project
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The project aims to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing the business to take proactive measures to retain them.

Project Overview
The core of this project is a machine learning model built to classify customers as either 'churn' or 'no churn'. The notebook covers the following key stages:

Data Loading and Exploration: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing features for model consumption.

Feature Engineering: Using one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Training and Evaluation: Training and evaluating a wide range of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting) using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Performance Summary: A summary of the performance of each model to identify the best-performing one.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a telecom_customer_churn.csv file, which includes various customer attributes such as demographics, services subscribed, and billing information.

Key Findings
The notebook identifies the Gradient Boosting Classifier as the best-performing model for this classification task. Its high accuracy demonstrates its potential for predicting customer churn effectively.

Technologies and Libraries
This project is built using Python and leverages several key libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building, evaluation, and data preprocessing.

Numpy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: (Optional, but recommended) For data visualization.

How to Run the Notebook
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

Place the telecom_customer_churn.csv dataset in the same directory as the notebook.

Open and run the notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab, or VS Code).
